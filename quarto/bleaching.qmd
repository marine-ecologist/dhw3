## Degree Heating Weeks

Corals are sensitive to warmer temperatures: at around one degree Celsius (1 °C) above the highest annual mean temperature corals exceed their "bleaching threshold". Degree Heating Weeks (DHW) are a useful metric of cumulative heatstress (i.e. how many times in the last twelve weeks has the temperature reached or exceeded the bleaching threshold?). From [NOAA](https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/product/5km/tutorial/crw10a_dhw_product.php):

> "By the time the accumulated heat stress (the DHW) reaches 4 °C-weeks, you can expect to see coral bleaching reef-wide, especially in more sensitive coral species. By the time the DHW value reaches 8 °C-weeks or higher, you are likely to see reef-wide coral bleaching with mortality of heat-sensitive corals"

## Corals, DHW, the Great Barrier Reef, and climate change

The Great Barrier Reef is undergoing rapid warming in the past three decades. A total of nine coral bleaching events have been recorded in 1998, 2002, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2020, 2022, 2024, and 2025. These events have resulted in [mass mortality of corals](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature21707), impacting [coral population structures](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2020.1432), [transforming assemblages](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0041-2), [delaying recovery](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.13707) and [restructuring entire ecosytems](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0359-9).

Long-term timeseries data helps prevent normalising the current state by providing historical context. For example, here is a timeseries for 560 reefs in the northern GBR spanning Lama Lama Sea Country to the Wuthathi sea country:

For a longer term pre-satellite perspective on the last two decades of climate change and ocean temperatures on the Great Barrier Reef:

> "The January–March Coral Sea heat extremes in 2024, 2017 and 2020 (in order of descending mean SST anomalies) were the warmest in 400 years, exceeding the 95th-percentile uncertainty limit of our reconstructed pre-1900 maximum. The 2016, 2004 and 2022 events were the next warmest, exceeding the 90th-percentile
